In this lab, I learned the basics of python and how it is different from C++. 
One thing I liked about Python is that the code is shorter and easier to read. 
I did not need to worry about variable types or semicolons,
which made the code faster and easier to write. Python also
looks more like normal English, which helped me understand what the code was doing.

One thing that was different than I expected is that Python uses certain 
indentation to control how the code works. In C/C++, indentation is mostly 
for readability, but in Python it is required for the program to run correctly.
 Python also does not need return types for functions, which is different from C++.

Python and C/C++ are similar because they both use loops, functions, and conditionals.
 However, Python needs less code and lets me focus more on the program logic. In C++, 
 I find that I need to be more careful with syntax and data types.
